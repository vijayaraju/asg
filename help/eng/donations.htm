<h2>Make a Donation</h2>

<div id="content">
<h3>Why does the program need a donation?</h3>
<p>I enjoy developing ASP scripts and in the same way in like developing this
	ASP Stats project that was born just like a need and a bet. </p>
<p>A bet to see if in ASP there were the possibilities to create a good stats
	application like in other languages. </p>
<p>A need of a full and dynamic stats application. </p>
<p>By the way also for these kind of passions and non commercial sites there
	are many mantaining costs. </p>
<p>Making a donation means helping the site to be kept free a public as at the
	moment and helping the program development and the current free support system. </p>
<h3>How may users send a donation?</h3>
<p>For the donation we have chosen <a href="https://www.paypal.com/row/mrb/pal=2UFMSVUX8TV2S">PayPal </a>,
	one of the most important online payment solution. <br >
PayPal in an <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay </a> company, founded in 1998. </p>
<p>It enables any individual or business with an email address to securely, easily
	and quickly send and receive payments online. <br >
	You can also use PayPal system without a PayPal account, as a normal credit
	card payment system. </p>
<p>PayPal is a worlwide solution based on a small fee that must be paid for each
	donation received. <br >
	In this way there are no costs for the donor. </p>
