<h2>Setup</h2>
<div id="content">

<p>The installation just needs some manual configurations 
	while the most part of the processes are executed by the setup file.</p>

<h3>STEP 1.</h3>
<p>Unzip downloaded file.<br />
	You'll find the following folders:</p>
<pre>
	<em>Unzipped Folder</em>
	|
	|-- <em>myasg</em> (it contains application files to upload on the server)
	|-- <em>help</em>  (it contains help documentation files)
	|
	|-- readme_[language].htm (file to browse documentation files.)
</pre>
<p>It's recommended to leave unchanged the default folder structure.
	Renaming files or folders could create problems using application.</p>

<h3>STEP 1b.</h3>
<p>In case you'd like to rename '<em>myasg</em>' folder please 
	adapt the right path also into stats_js.asp file.</p>

<h3>STEP 2.</h3>
<p>Edit and adapt the connection strings to databases and skin file.</p>
<p><strong>ATTENTION</strong>:<br />
	For a correct use of the application, databases need a folder with write permissions
	activated by webserver consolle.
	For higher security, browse and download permissions should be denied.<br />
	Usually, paid web hosting services provide particular folders 
	with special access permissions or restrictions.
	Before continuing the installation, 
	please check with your web host for the location of these folders.<br />
	Many free hosting services do not offer special access permissions or restrictions.<br />
	Change the following strings with the path to these folders.</p>
<p>These strings need to be adapted.</p>
<p>File <em>includes/inc_config.asp</em>:<br />
	- Const strAsgPathFolderDb = <strong>"mdb/"</strong> 'Change the path to your database folder <br />
	- Const strAsgPathFolderWr = <strong>"mdb/"</strong> 'Change the path to a folder with write permissions.<br />
	It could be the same path as the database folder.</p>
<p>File <em>config.asp</em>:<br />
	- Change inclusion string of the file inc_skin_file.asp 
	(&lt;!--#include file=&quot;../database/inc_skin_file.asp&quot;--&gt;) to the right path,
	inserting the path to the folder you specified before as <em>strAsgPathFolderWr</em>.</p>
	
<h3>STEP 3.</h3>
<p>Upload the folder '<em>myasg</em>' into the root of your site on the server, 
	excluding the content of '<em>mdb</em>' folder.</p>
<p>When the upload is complete, upload the '<em>mdb</em>' folder in this way:<br />
	- <em>databases</em> into the folder specified on the first step (first path) <br />
	- File <em>inc_skin_file.asp</em> into the folder specified on the first step (second path)</p>
	
<h3>STEP 4.</h3>
<p>Open your browser and in your address box, type the URL 
	<em>http://<strong>www.mysite.com</strong>/myasg/setup.asp</em>
	changing <em>www.mysite.com</em> with the appropriate site URL.</p>
<p>If previous steps have been successfully completed, 
	you will now see the setup page. <br />
	If you see an error, it will most probably be caused 
	by an error in the database or folder path.</p>

<p>Carry on with the <a href="config.htm" title="Configurazione Applicazione" target="_self">next step</a>.</p>
